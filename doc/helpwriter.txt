1. Introduction

Helpfiles are incredibly useful, especially to the end-user. However, they can
also be useful for customisers, or people who want to try to help develop the
plugin at any capacity.

Unfortunately, Vim does not make this job particularly easy.

Out of the box, many of the built-in helpfile structures are hard to figure out,
type, or both. Many of the common styles of help writing also rely on
multiple types of alignment on one line, particularly in the context of
headers, which makes them a pain in the ass to write using Vim's built-in
formatting tools.

As it currently stands, writing helpfiles is a _lot_ of copypasta, a lot of
manual alignment, and a lot of manual management in general.

This plugin exists to automate or at least reduce the manual work required for
many of these often tedious tasks, by introducing mappings, structure object
generation, and maybe even some fancier tools involving automatically generating
or changing certain types of structure-related text on-demand in the future.
