1. Introduction

Helpfiles are incredibly useful, especially to the end-user. However, they can
also be useful for customisers, or people who want to try to help develop the
plugin at any capacity.

Unfortunately, Vim does not make this job particularly easy.

Out of the box, many of the built-in helpfile structures are hard to figure out,
type, or both. Many of the common styles of help writing also rely on
multiple types of alignment on one line, particularly in the context of
headers, which makes them a pain in the ass to write using Vim's built-in
formatting tools.

As it currently stands, writing helpfiles is a _lot_ of copypasta, a lot of
manual alignment, and a lot of manual management in general.

This plugin exists to automate or at least reduce the manual work required for
many of these often tedious tasks, by introducing mappings, structure object
generation, and maybe even some fancier tools involving automatically generating
or changing certain types of structure-related text on-demand in the future.

2. Enforced options

Certain options are enforced out of necessity.

This currently only applies to |'textwidth'|.
Many of the aspects of help files rely on having some document width. To
generate headers, the header needs a width. There's a built-in facility in Vim
for this, and as most of the editor experience in help files massively benefit
form having a textwidth set, this is what helpwriter uses.
                                                              *textwidth-override*
                                                   *helpwriter-textwidth-override*
If |'textwidth'| is undefined, helpwriter automatically sets it to 80.
'textwidth' is not required to be any particular value, but it is required to be
non-zero and set.

Should you manually override it after helpwriter defines it, and either unset it
or set to a non-positive value, the behaviour of helpwriter is undefined. If you
need to not have 'textwidth' set for help documents, it's better that you don't
use this plugin.
